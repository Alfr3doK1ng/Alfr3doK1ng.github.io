I recently started my self learning of distributed systems.

To get started, I first need to understand how a consensus algorithm can help in building said systems.

I went through the original [raft paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) and a very helpful [illustration video
in Chinese](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pr4y1b7H5/?spm_id_from=333.788) to have a very basic understanding of
the algorithm.

To better solidify such knowledge in my brain, I decided to write a blog post to write down my thought process and
then see where it goes from here. Here is a xmind graph I made to help myself sort things out.
